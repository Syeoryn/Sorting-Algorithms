// Radix sort is a noncomparative sort (often for integers)
// that sorts based on the value of each digit of each value.
// Starting with either the least significant digit or most significant digit,
// each value is placed into a bucket based on that value.  The values are then
// resorted based on the next digit, and so on until all m sorts have been completed
// where m is the length of the largest number
// Radix sort is a stable sort, meaning that when multiple values are placed in the same
// bucket, order is maintained from the previous order
