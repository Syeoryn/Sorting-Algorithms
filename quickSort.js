// Quick sort starts with the value at index 0, treating it as a pivot, 
// and sorts the array into two chunks: values greater, and values less than the pivot
// Then, the pivot is placed in the middle of these two chunks, which is it's final position.
// This is then repeated for the left half and the right half, until all chunks are sorted.

// To sort array into chunks, two pointers are maintained.  A left pointer, which starts at index 1
// and moves right until a value greater than the pivot is found; and a right pointer, which starts
// at index length - 1 and moves left until a value less than the pivot is found.  Once the left and 
// right pivots cross each other (or equal each other), the pivot is swapped with the value one index
// to the left of the left pointer.  If both pointers stop before equaling each other, the two values
// the pointers point at are swapped, and the pointers continue progressing until they equal each other.
// This is done recursively with the base case of an array of length 0 or 1, as these arrays are already
// sorted.

// Efficient implementations of quick sort are done in place, but are not stable.
