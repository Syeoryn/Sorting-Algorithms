// cocktail sort is a bi-directional bubble sort.
// Starting at the beginning and iterating forward,
// the largest value is found and swapped into the last postion.
// Moving backwards from the end, the smallest value is found
// and swapped into the first position.
// This is then repeated to swap the second largest value
// into the second to last position, and so on 
// until the array is sorted.
